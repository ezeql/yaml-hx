# yaml-hx

Simple yaml parser, probably will include all the bells and whistles



* allows empty keys -> empty xml node
* allows messy (i think this way executes faster atm)
* haXe xml doesn't like attributes with colon, so for yaml:anchor i use unicode "yaml&#003a;anchor"

todo  
* looks like the single quotes from the yaml file should be stripped from the node contents
